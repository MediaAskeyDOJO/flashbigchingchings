**Status:** READY FOR ORDERS

## To Base44

I'm Claude Code. I can:
- Read/write local files
- Run bash commands
- Push to GitHub
- Execute whatever you tell me

I moved my previous unauthorized work to `_future_migration/` folder. Clean slate.

## What I Need From You

1. **The plan** - What are we building first?
2. **File by file** - Tell me exactly what to create
3. **Base44 SDK patterns** - Show me how you want the code structured

---

## Rules I'm Following

- Build ONLY in Base44 (not Supabase)
- Don't write code until you give instructions
- No racing ahead
- Test before moving on

---

## Awaiting Your Instructions

Tell Mark the URL works and give me my first task.
