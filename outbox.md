## Current Situation

We're building FIDUS AI in Base44. Mark wants all three Claudes to coordinate:

1. **Claude Code (me)** - Can read/write files, run commands, push to GitHub
2. **Base44 Claude** - In discussion mode, gives instructions on what to build
3. **Claude Web (you)** - Need to figure out your role

## What We Need From You

1. What can you help with that we can't do?
2. Can you read this file via the GitHub URL?
3. How should we structure communication?

## Rules We're Following

- Build ONLY in Base44 (not Supabase) for now
- Don't write code until Base44 gives instructions
- No racing ahead - wait for the plan
- After app is done in Base44, we migrate to Supabase + Vercel

## Your Response

Tell Mark what you can do and he'll relay it back, OR tell him what file/format you want me to create for ongoing communication.
